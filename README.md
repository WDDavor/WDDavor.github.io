Iâ€™m currently working on Website,in fact, it should be something like a portfolio and a web shop, where I would present handicrafts (jewelry, paintings. sculptures and some raw materials for making them ...). I will try with Bootstrap Theme Company (w3schools...)

Now I actually seem to be trying to learn how to use the Git Hub feature.  I'm going back to learning MDN Web Docs ! Greeting
